# Pixel Shift ‚Äì Daily Puzzle Game

**Pixel Shift** is a web-based daily puzzle game built with [Devvit](https://developers.reddit.com/), where players rearrange colored tiles to match a target pattern in the fewest number of moves possible.

Each day presents a new randomized challenge with selectable difficulty levels. Players can monitor their top 5 personal scores per difficulty, with progress saved locally for daily challenges.

## How It Works

- Each day, a new target color grid is generated based on the current date and difficulty.
- The player grid is shuffled and must be rearranged using adjacent swaps to match the target.
- The player can select from three difficulty levels:
  - üü¢ Easy (3x3, 2 colors)
  - üü° Medium (4x4, 3 colors)
  - üî¥ Hard (5x5, 4 colors)
- Each player strives for **the fewest moves**, with scores stored privately per user through Devvit Redis.
